# panann

Pipelines for gene and TE annotation of pangenomes.
We have a particular focus on Fungal pathogen genomes, but the principles could be adapted to other systems.

This is a work in progress and mostly developed for personal use.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/darcyabjones/panann/wiki) for details, research, and updates.
