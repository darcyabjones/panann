# Small test data-sets

This is a small-ish dataset for developing the pipeline.

The genome is the first chromosome from _Aspergillus fumigatus_ isolate A1163 and collected from EnsemblFungi <http://fungi.ensembl.org/Aspergillus_fumigatusa1163/Info/Index>.

The RNAseq data is from Watkins and Liu et al (2018; doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000154), from _Aspergillus fumigatus_ strains Af293 or CEA10.
Reads were downloaded from SRA archives SRR6163911 and SRR6163776 (BioProject PRJNA399754), which are both replicates of conidia in culture at 16 hours.
